-  **Macroeconomic Implications of Uniform Pricing**  
with Diego Daruich [Working paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2019/2019-024.pdf?1){:target="_blank"} * Accepted, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics* 

    > We introduce novel data from Argentina and show that there is uniform pricing (chains set the same prices across stores both within and across regions), and prices react relatively little to local conditions. We build a model to understand the macroeconomic implications of uniform pricing. Our key finding is that consumption aggregate elasticities tend to be smaller than local elasticities, as prices react more to aggregate conditions when prices are set uniformly across regions.


- **Long-Term Finance and Investment with Frictional Asset Markets**  
*American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2021, vol. 13(4)* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/Kozlowski_Inv_2019_latest.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > Trading frictions in financial markets lead to a liquidity spread which increases with maturity and generates an upward sloping yield curve. Hence, trading frictions induce firms to borrow and invest at shorter horizons. Reductions in trading frictions—a new channel of financial development—can promote economic development. We use insights from the theory to measure the slope of liquidity spreads in the data.

- **Scarring Body and Mind: The Long-Term Belief-Scarring Effects of COVID-19**  
with Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran, *2020 Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium Proceedings* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/KVV_covid_v4.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > The largest economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic could arise if it changed behavior long after the immediate health crisis is resolved. We show how to quantify the extent of such belief changes and determine their impact on future economic outcomes.

- **The Tail that Wags the Economy: Belief-Driven Business Cycles and Persistent Stagnation**  
with Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran, *Journal of Political Economy, 2020, vol. 128(8)* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/KVV.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > The great recession has been more persistent than others because observing an unlikely event led us to re-assess the probability of tail events. This change in beliefs endures long after the event itself has passed.


- **Explaining Intergenerational Mobility: The Role of Fertility and Family Transfers**  
with Diego Daruich, *Review of Economics Dynamics, 2020, vol. 36* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/DK.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > Poor families have more children and transfer fewer resources to them. This suggests that family decisions about fertility and transfers can dampen intergenerational mobility. The model, estimated to the US in the 2000s, implies that a counterfactual flat income-fertility profile would reduce intergenerational persistence by about 7%.


- **The Tail that Keeps the Riskless Rate Low**  
with Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran, *NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2018, vol. 33* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/KVV_InterestRate.pdf){:target="_blank"}
 
    > The 2008 financial crisis was an unlikely event led us to re-assess the probability of tail events. The knowledge that such an event can happen raises the value of riskless assets for many years.


- **Investment and Bilateral Insurance**  
with Emilio Espino and Juan Sanchez, *Journal of Economic Theory 2018, vol. 176* [paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/EKS.pdf){:target="_blank"}
 
    > Private information may limit insurance possibilities when two agents get together to pool idiosyncratic risk. However, if there is capital accumulation, bilateral insurance possibilities improve because misreporting distorts investment.

- **Domestic Policies and Sovereign Default**  
with Emilio Espino, Fernando M. Martin and Juan M. Sanchez [Working paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2020/2020-017.pdf){:target="_blank"}

	> Incorporate monetary and fiscal policies in a model of sovereign default to study the response of emerging markets to terms-of-trade shocks.

- **Credit and Liquidity Policies during Large Crises**  
with Mahdi Ebsim and Migel Faria e Castro [Working paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2020/2020-035.pdf){:target="_blank"}

	> We compare firms' financials during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) and COVID-19. While the two crises featured similar increases in credit spreads, debt and liquid assets decreased during the GFC, but increased during COVID-19. In the cross section, leverage was the main determinant of credit spreads and investment during the GFC, but liquidity was more important during COVID-19. We augment a quantitative model of firm capital structure with a motive to hold liquid assets. The GFC resembled a combination of productivity and financial shocks, while COVID-19 also featured liquidity shocks. We study the state-dependent effects of credit and liquidity policies.
