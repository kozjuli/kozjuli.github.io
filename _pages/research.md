## Publications <a name="publications"></a>
1. **The Tail that Wags the Economy: Belief-Driven Business Cycles and Persistent Stagnation**
with Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran, *Journal of Political Economy, forthcoming* [working paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/KVV.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > The great recession has been more persistent than others because observing an unlikely event led us to re-assess the probability of tail events. This change in beliefs endures long after the event itself has passed.


2. **The Tail that Keeps the Riskless Rate Low**
with Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran, *NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2018, vol. 33* [Publication](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c14073){:target="_blank"}
 
    > The 2008 financial crisis was an unlikely event led us to re-assess the probability of tail events. The knowledge that such an event can happen raises the value of riskless assets for many years.


3. **Investment and Bilateral Insurance**
with Emilio Espino and Juan Sanchez, *Journal of Economic Theory 2018, vol. 176* [Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002205311830098X){:target="_blank"}, [working paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/EKS.pdf){:target="_blank"}
 
    > Private information may limit insurance possibilities when two agents get together to pool idiosyncratic risk. However, if there is capital accumulation, bilateral insurance possibilities improve because misreporting distorts investment.

4. **Explaining Intergenerational Mobility: The Role of Fertility and Family Transfers**
with Diego Daruich, conditionally accepted at *Review of Economics Dynamics* [Working paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/DK.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > Poor families have more children and transfer fewer resources to them. This suggests that family decisions about fertility and transfers can dampen intergenerational mobility. The model, estimated to the US in the 2000s, implies that a counterfactual flat income-fertility profile would reduce intergenerational persistence by about 7%.


5. **Long-Term Finance and Investment with Frictional Asset Markets**
 [Working paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/Kozlowski_Inv_2019_latest.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > Trading frictions in financial markets lead to a liquidity spread which increases with maturity and generates an upward sloping yield curve. Hence, trading frictions induce firms to borrow and invest at shorter horizons. Reductions in trading frictions—a new channel of financial development—can promote economic development. We use insights from the theory to measure the slope of liquidity spreads in the data.

 
6.  **Macroeconomic Implications of Uniform Pricing**
with Diego Daruich [Working paper](http://www.juliankozlowski.com/papers/DK_prices_2019_latest.pdf){:target="_blank"}

    > We introduce novel data from Argentina and show that there is uniform pricing (chains set the same prices across stores both within and across regions), and prices react relatively little to local conditions. We build a model to understand the macroeconomic implications of uniform pricing. Our key finding is that consumption aggregate elasticities tend to be smaller than local elasticities, as prices react more to aggregate conditions when prices are set uniformly across regions.
